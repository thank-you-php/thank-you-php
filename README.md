Dear PHP,

PHP changed the way we develop web applications and influenced many developers
and projects.

We want to thank [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://github.com/rlerdorf), the [PHP group](http://php.net),
PHP core maintainers, contributors, and people involved in PHP for making the PHP
language and making the PHP ecosytem a better place for developers and for all
you've done and do.

PHP, thank you very much.

Inspired by the [Thank You Github](https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github),
and [Thank You Laravel](https://github.com/thank-you-laravel/thank-you-laravel).

Signed,
